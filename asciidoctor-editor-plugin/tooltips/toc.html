toc
<br><br>
A table of contents (TOC) is an index of section and subsection titles that can be automatically 
generated from the document’s structure when converting a document with Asciidoctor.
<br><br>
<b>Be aware:</b> the TOC statement is replaced by this eclipse plugin on preview! By the special 
toolbar action you can toggle the TOC. But the attribute is still interesting when you are creating
your documents in your build (e.g. by gradle)  
<br><br>
To enable the auto-generated TOC, you must set the toc attribute. You can do this inside the document
or by CLI command.
