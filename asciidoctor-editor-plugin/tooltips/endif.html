endif
<br><br>
Content between the ifdef and endif directives gets included if the specified attribute is set:
<div class='example'>
ifdef::env-github[]
	This content is for GitHub only.
endif::[]
</div>
The syntax of the start directive is ifdef::$attribute[], where $attribute is the name of an attribute.
<br><br>
Keep in mind that the content is not limited to a single line. You can have any amount of content between the ifdef and endif directives.
<br><br>
If you have a large amount of content inside the ifdef directive, you may find it more readable to use the long-form version of the directive, in which the attribute (aka condition) is referenced again in the endif directive.

endif long-form example
<div class='example'>
ifdef::env-github[]
	This content is for GitHub only.
	
	So much content in this section, I'd get confused reading the source without the 
	closing `ifdef` directive.
	
	It isn't necessary for short blocks, but if you are conditionally including a section 
	it may be something worth considering.

	Other readers reviewing your docs source code may go cross-eyed when reading your source 
	docs if you don't.
