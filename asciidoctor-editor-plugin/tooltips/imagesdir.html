imagesdir
<br><br>
The imagesdir document attribute can be used to specify the location of images that are 
referenced in the document using a relative path. 
<br><br>
We recommend using the imagesdir attribute to avoid hard-coding the common path to your images 
in every single image macro.
<br><br>
The value of the imagesdir attribute can be an absolute path, relative path or URI. 
By default, the value of the imagesdir attribute is empty, which means these images 
are resolved relative to the document. If the image target is an absolute path or URI, the imagesdir
 prefix is not added to the path
