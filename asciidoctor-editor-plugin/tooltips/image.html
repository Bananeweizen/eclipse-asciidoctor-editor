image
<br><br>

To include an image on its own line (i.e., a block image), use the image:: prefix in front of the file name and square brackets after it.
<div class="example">
image::sunset.jpg[]
</div>

If you want to specify alt text, include it inside the square brackets:
<div class="example">
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset]

// you can also give the size into square brackts:
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset,300,200]

// an images with an URL and size given:
image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Tux.svg[Tux,250,350]
</div>
If you want to include an image <b>inline</b>, use the image: prefix instead (notice there is <b>only one</b> colon):
<div class="example">
Click image:icons/play.png[Play, title="Play"] to get the party started.

Click image:icons/pause.png[title="Pause"] when you need a break.

</div>
