== About

This file represents a problem case for https://github.com/de-jcup/eclipse-asciidoctor-editor/issues/193

To reproduce failure situation you can do following:

- start your eclipse with file.encoding=cp1252 enabled +
   _(should be done on a windows instance)_
- open the file inside asciidoctor editor
- before bugfix you got no preview but an asciidoc error about file name problems 

=== What happens (without bugfix)?

File.getName() does rely on the `file.enconding` system property. 
But embedded asciidoctor instance seems to  rely on `UTF-8`.

On startup there is a problem, because given filename String is no UTF-8 but another encoded char 
sequence...

As a bugfix / workaround the filename will be now normalized to ascii only chars when `file.encoding`
is not `UTF-8`. Having an editor id inside name of hidden file even similar names do not matter.
